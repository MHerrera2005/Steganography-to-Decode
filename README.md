# Steganography-to-Decode
My project will is LSB Steganography to find hidden messages.
In a gray scale image each pixel is represented in 8 bits. The last bit in a pixel is called as Least Significant bit as its value will affect the pixel only by "1". So, this property is used to hide the data in teh image. If anyone have considered last two bits as LSB bits as they will affect the pixel value by "3"
The LSB embedding apporach has become the basis of many techniques that hid emessages with multimedia carrier data. LSB embedding may even be applies in particular data domains-for example, embedding a hidden message int the color values of RGB bitmap data
